CS223 Digital Design Xilinix,Vivado,FPGA labs

## Overview
This repository contains several labs on digital design concepts using Verilog. The labs cover fundamental topics in combinational and sequential logic design.

## Labs
1. **Basic Gates**  
   Implementation of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) using Verilog.

2. **Multiplexers and Decoders**  
   Working with MUX and DECODER circuits.

3. **Flip-Flops**  
   Introduction to sequential circuits using flip-flops (D, T, JK).

4. **Counters**  
   Design of synchronous and asynchronous counters.

5. **ALU Design**  
   Building an Arithmetic Logic Unit in Verilog.

6. **FSM**  
   Implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM).

7. **Memory Design**  
   Simulation of a basic RAM module.
